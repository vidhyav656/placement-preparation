## How to land a job in 2026

Placement Strategy:

This section aims to equip students with a proactive and structured approach to their placement journey. It's about more than just applying for jobs; it's about strategically positioning themselves for success.

1\. Importance of Early Preparation:

- The Early Bird Advantage: The placement process isn't a sprint, but a marathon. Starting early in the 3rd year gives students a significant edge. Many companies begin their recruitment process well in advance.
- Time for Skill Development: Early preparation allows ample time to identify skill gaps and work on improving them. Rushing at the last minute often leads to superficial preparation and increased stress.
- More Opportunities: Early starters have access to a wider range of opportunities. Some companies may close their applications early if they receive a large number of qualified candidates.
- Reduced Stress: Starting early allows for a more relaxed and organized approach. Students can avoid the pressure of last-minute applications and interview preparation.
- Building a Strong Foundation: Early preparation allows students to build a strong foundation in terms of skills, resume, and interview preparation, which increases their confidence.
- Example: Share a brief anecdote about a student who benefited from early preparation (without revealing any confidential information).
